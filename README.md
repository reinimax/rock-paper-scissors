Welcome to Rock - Paper - Scissors!

I built this project in the course of The Odin Project curriculum.

By now, it basically works with a minimalistic UI. I want to prettify it a bit, without spending too much additional time on it.
Because, you really can do lots of stuff with it if you're so inclined. But what do I want to have?

-A beautiful layout. Simple styled buttons will do though, no pictures/icons.
-A collapsable log
-The game should really end after 5 points are reached, and there should be a button that allows you to play again.
--if you hit "Play again" of course the score and log should be reset.
